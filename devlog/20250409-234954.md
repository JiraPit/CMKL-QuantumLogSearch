# CMKL Quantum Recommender System - Development Log

## System Architecture
- **Embedding Module**: 
  - `sentence_embedding.py`: Embeds text content into vectors using Sentence Transformers
  - `q_state_embedding.py`: Embeds vectors into quantum state amplitudes
  - Added PCA dimensionality reduction to reduce quantum state size

- **Similarity Search Module**:
  - `circuit_builder.py`: Builds quantum circuits for similarity search
  - `simulator.py`: Implements Grover's algorithm simulation for quantum similarity search
  - `utils/create_state.py`: Utility for quantum state creation

- **Main Application**:
  - `main.py`: Main recommender system interface
  - `main_sentence_to_state.py`: Demo showing embedding and quantum state encoding workflow

## Key Implementation Details

### Data Processing Flow
1. Load articles from CSV dataset
2. Generate sentence embeddings from article title+description 
3. Apply PCA to reduce embedding dimensions
4. Encode reduced vectors as quantum states
5. Use quantum similarity search to find related articles

### Important Instructions
- The simulator.py module should be used directly to perform quantum similarity searches
- No custom similarity search algorithms should be implemented in the main file
- main_sentence_to_state.py should focus only on demonstrating the embedding process
- main.py is the primary entry point for the recommendation system

### Changes Made During Development
1. Implemented interactive recommendation system in main.py
2. Added PCA dimensionality reduction to the SentenceEmbedder class
3. Modified the simulator module to add a find_similar_states function
4. Updated main.py to use the proper quantum similarity search algorithm
5. Created README.md with usage instructions

## Dataset Structure
The article database contains:
- Index
- Article full name
- Article description 
- Article body

Only full name and description are used for generating embeddings.

# CMKL Quantum Recommender System - Development Log

## Circuit Optimization and Quantum Foundations

### System Updates
- **Quantum-First Approach**: 
  - Eliminated redundant classical similarity calculations
  - Modified system to rely solely on quantum circuit outputs
  - Removed post-processing similarity recalculations
  - Maintained circuit design while simplifying result processing

### Key Quantum Concepts Clarified

#### Measurement and Shots
- **Quantum Measurement**: 
  - Each "shot" represents one complete circuit execution with measurement
  - Each individual shot collapses quantum state to exactly one bitstring
  - Multiple shots (e.g., 1024) build a statistical distribution
  - High shot counts reveal probability distribution created by the circuit

#### Grover's Algorithm Implementation
- **Iterations vs. Shots**:
  - **Iterations**: Number of Grover operator applications within one circuit run (oracle + diffusion)
  - **Shots**: Number of complete circuit executions from start to finish
  - Each shot executes the full circuit including all iterations

- **Optimal Iterations**:
  - Formula used: π/4·√(N/M) where:
    - N = total states (2^num_qubits)
    - M = estimated matching solutions based on threshold
  - Big O notation: O(√(N/M)) for iteration count
  - Different thresholds change fraction of anticipated matches:
    - threshold > 0.9: ~1/8 of states expected to match
    - threshold > 0.7: ~1/4 of states expected to match
    - threshold > 0.5: ~3/8 of states expected to match

#### Computational Complexity
- **Classical KNN**:
  - Distance calculation: O(N·d) where N = database size, d = dimension
  - Sorting results: O(N log N)
  - Overall: O(N·d + N log N)

- **Quantum Approach**:
  - State preparation: O(2^n) for n qubits per state
  - Grover iterations: O(√(N/M))
  - Final sorting: O(N log N) in worst case
  - Overall: O(2^n + √(N/M) + N log N)
  - Theoretical quadratic speedup in search component

### Modified Components
- **simulator.py**: 
  - Simplified `simulate_and_analyze` to only return measurement counts
  - Redesigned `find_similar_states` to use circuit outputs directly
  - Removed all post-processing similarity calculations
  - Used bitstring to index mapping for result interpretation

### Next Steps
- Evaluate actual performance on real quantum hardware
- Benchmark against classical implementations
- Explore optimizations for state preparation
- Consider dedicated hardware-specific optimizations

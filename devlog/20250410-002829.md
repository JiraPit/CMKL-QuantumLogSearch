# CMKL Quantum Recommender System - Development Log

## System Optimization

### Performance Enhancements
- **Resource Constraint Solution**: 
  - Modified system to handle only 30 articles due to computational limitations
  - Implemented pre-computation workflow to separate resource-intensive embedding generation
  - Created pickle-based storage for embeddings to avoid redundant calculations

### New Components
- **pre_embed.py**: 
  - Pre-computes article embeddings (6 steps)
    1. Loads full article dataset
    2. Generates sentence embeddings for all entries
    3. Applies PCA to reduce dimensions to 64 components
    4. Selects a subset of 30 entries to reduce computational load
    5. Creates a filtered dataset with selected entries
    6. Saves embeddings and filtered dataset to pickle file

- **pre_computed/**: 
  - New directory for storing pre-computed data
  - Contains pickle files with embeddings and reduced dataset

### Modified Components
- **main.py**: 
  - Updated to work with pre-computed embeddings
  - Added check for pre-computed data
  - Reduced computational load by only encoding vectors to quantum states at runtime
  - Improved error handling for the subset of articles

### Data Processing Flow (Updated)
1. Pre-computation (run once):
   - Load articles from CSV dataset
   - Generate sentence embeddings from article title+description
   - Apply PCA to reduce embedding dimensions (64 components)
   - Select 30 entries to reduce computational requirements
   - Save to pickle file

2. At runtime (each execution):
   - Load pre-computed embeddings and filtered dataset
   - Encode reduced vectors as quantum states
   - Use quantum similarity search to find related articles

### User Experience
- Faster startup time for the recommender system
- Clearer indication of available article range (0-29)
- More efficient resource utilization
- Better error messages for index validation

### Next Steps
- Consider implementing batch processing for quantum state encoding
- Explore further optimizations for quantum circuit depth
- Evaluate alternative dimensionality reduction techniques
